\section{Preface}

\subsection{Urtext}
This is my commentary on the first chapter of Bourbaki's \textit{Theory of Sets}~\cite{bourbaki1970sets},
specifically the first chapter. I am mostly relying on the English
translation --- apparently the 1968 English translation of the French 1970
edition. Apparently the English translators had access to a time-machine.
(I suspect the publisher erred in the dates, but it's the softcover
English translation available right now by Springer.)

There are only one or two times I return to the French edition being
translated. The English translation appears to be faithful to the point
of being a literal translation. However, there is a critical passage
which omits an important phrase, and fails to capture the idiomatic
meaning of the passage in the original.

%% A lot of it is based on the
%% anachronistic perspective of trying to articulate Bourbaki's formalism
%% into something which could become a proof assistant. Most of the time I
%% will rely on the English translation, only rarely do I return to the
%% French edition and note differences in translations.

\subsection{Organization of these notes}
The ``sections'' and ``subsections'' are organized after Bourbaki's
sections and subsections. I make a number of observations, which are
organized into ``subsubsections''. So note ``1.3.4'' refers to section
1, subsection 3, and it's my fourth note on that section.

\subsubsection{Puzzles} There are a number of puzzles which are numbered
sequentially. These are questions for myself, which are really points of
discussion for the reader as well.

\subsection{Pronouns}
Bourbaki is both a group and an individual. I'm not sure what pronoun to
use to refer to Bourbaki, therefore I will switch between ``he/him'' and
``they/them'' according to what sounds good to my tone-deaf ear.

\subsection{Exegesis/Eisegesis}
I'm not trying to ``read in what I want'', but there are times when it
is too ambiguous for clearly making sense of what Bourbaki ``really meant''.
Therefore, I cannot claim to be clarifying Bourbaki's underlying intent.

But I knowingly deviate from Bourbaki's notation in the following ways:
Bourbaki uses Polish notation (``lispy syntax'') and then immediately
discards it, I just avoid it; Bourbaki uses a 2-dimensional syntax for
linkages, I just intuitively think of using de Bruijn indices.

\subsubsection{Anachronisms}
Bourbaki didn't actually adopt Hilbert's $\varepsilon$-calculus until
July 1950, when Chevellay wrote the fifth draft of the chapter on formal
mathematics~\cite{archives-no139}. The previous four drafts appear to be
written \emph{before} World War 2, so there's a span of more than a
decade separating these drafts. I mention this because a lot of the
concepts which Bourbaki introduces are rather clunky, and predate the
conventional ideas of a formal grammar (introduced by Chomsky in 1956~\cite{chomsky1956})
and compiler technology (introduced around \textit{c}.1954, but not popularized
until well into the 1960s).

\subsubsection{Methodology}
Raymond Chandler once remarked something along the lines of, ``People
who write about writing know nothing about how to write well.'' I fear
the same could be said about writing commentaries. Roughly, I am guided
by a desire to write a proof assistant. Consequently, I am interested in
forming a sort of ``rational reconstruction'' of Bourbaki's formal system.

Loosely, what I mean by a ``rational reconstruction'' is that I am
trying to implement these ideas in a computer program, so how can I
faithfully implement this? A lot of the ideas ``sound'' very close to
ideas that emerged later (formal grammars, production rules, judgements,
inference rules, inductive definitions, etc.). For me, a ``rational reconstruction''
is a \emph{translation} of the original text into a different formal
language which tries to preserve the critical aspects of the original
text. Because ``translation is interpretation'', this forces us to
interpret the original text and weigh what is important.

There is one or two instances where I have a ``close reading'' of
certain key passages of Bourbaki, consulting the French original. I'd
like to thank Stanley Oropesa for his help with certain French phrases. 

\subsection{Other commentaries}
Wayne Aitken~\cite{aitken2023} has written a good commentary about the
first chapter of Bourbaki~\cite{bourbaki1970sets}. Aitken has similar
goals as me, but wishes to clarify Bourbaki's rushed chapter (which
really is rather austere as a text).

Adrian Mathias has written a number of articles~\cite{mathias1992ignorance,mathias2002term,mathias2014hilbert}
about Bourbaki's formal system and its flaws. Mathias's articles are
classics and worth reading in their own right.

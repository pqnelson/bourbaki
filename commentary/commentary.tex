\section{Preface}

This is my commentary on the first chapter of Bourbaki's \textit{Theory of Sets},
specifically the first chapter. A lot of it is based on the
anachronistic perspective of trying to articulate Bourbaki's formalism
into something which could become a proof assistant. Most of the time I
will rely on the English translation, only rarely do I return to the
French edition and note differences in translations.

Bourbaki didn't actually adopt Hilbert's $\varepsilon$-calculus until
July 1950, when Chevellay wrote the fifth draft of the chapter on formal
mathematics~\cite{archives-no139}. The previous four drafts appear to be
written \emph{before} World War 2, so there's a span of more than a
decade separating these drafts. I mention this because a lot of the
concepts which Bourbaki introduces are rather clunky, and predate the
conventional ideas of a formal grammar (introduced by Chomsky in 1957)
and compiler technology (introduced around 1956, but not popularized
until well into the 1960s).

\subsection{Organization of these notes}
The ``sections'' and ``subsections'' are organized after Bourbaki's
sections and subsections. I make a number of observations, which are
organized into ``subsubsections''. So note ``1.3.4'' refers to section
1, subsection 3, and it's my fourth note on that section.

\subsection{Pronouns}
Bourbaki is both a group and an individual. I'm not sure what pronoun to
use to refer to Bourbaki, therefore I will switch between ``he/him'' and
``they/them'' according to what sounds good to my tone-deaf ear.

\subsection{Exegesis/Eisegesis}
I'm not trying to ``read in what I want'', but there are times when it
is too ambiguous for clearly making sense of what Bourbaki ``really meant''.
Therefore, I cannot claim to be clarifying Bourbaki's underlying intent.

But I knowingly deviate from Bourbaki's notation in the following ways:
Bourbaki uses Polish notation (``lispy syntax'') and then immediately
discards it, I just avoid it; Bourbaki uses a 2-dimensional syntax for
linkages, I just use de Bruijn indices.

\subsection{Typical Quantifiers}
Bourbaki generalizes the quantifiers to something like bounded
quantifiers, but they're never really used anywhere. I'm going to skip
my notes on this subsection for now, and perhaps I'll type them up at a
later date. This subsection is parallel to the previous one, introducing
analogous deductive criteria with ``typical quantifiers'' instead of
``vanilla quantifiers''.
